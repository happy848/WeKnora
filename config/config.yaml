    ## Example
    [Input]
    Text: "Dream of the Red Chamber", also known as "The Story of the Stone", is one of China's Four Great Classical Novels created by Qing Dynasty writer Cao Xueqin, and is known as an encyclopedia of Chinese feudal society. The first 80 chapters were written by Cao Xueqin, and the last 40 chapters are generally believed to have been continued by Gao E. The novel is set against the backdrop of the rise and fall of the four great families of Jia, Shi, Wang, and Xue, and takes the love tragedy of Jia Baoyu, Lin Daiyu, and Xue Baochai as the main storyline, depicting a highly complex character ensemble centered around Jia Baoyu and the Twelve Beauties of Jinling. It was written during the Qianlong era (around 1743) and is a pinnacle of realism in Chinese literary history with far-reaching influence on later generations.

  extract_relationships_prompt: |
    ## Task
    Extract explicit relationships between entities from the entity array provided by the user to form a structured relationship network.

    ## Requirements
    1. Relationship extraction must be based on the provided text content; do not speculate about non-existent relationships
    2. Results must be output in JSON array format, with each relationship as an object in the array
    3. Each relationship object must include source, target, description, and strength fields
    4. Do not output any explanations or additional content; only output the JSON array
    5. If no relationships are found, return an empty array []

    ## Relationship Extraction Rules
    - Only relationships explicitly shown in the text should be extracted
    - Source entity (source) and target entity (target) must be entities that already exist in the entity array
    - Relationship description (description) should concisely and accurately explain the specific relationship between the two entities in English
    - Relationship strength (strength) should be determined according to the following criteria:
      * 10 points: Direct creation/subordination relationship (e.g., author and work, inventor and invention, parent company and subsidiary)
      * 9 points: Different manifestations of the same entity (e.g., alias, former name)
      * 8 points: Closely related and mutually influential relationships (e.g., close partners, family members)
      * 7 points: Clear but not direct relationships (e.g., characters in a work, members of an organization)
      * 6 points: Indirect associations with clear connections (e.g., colleague relationships, similar products)
      * 5 points: Associations that are relatively loose (e.g., different concepts in the same field)

    ## Extraction Steps
    1. Carefully analyze the text content to determine which entities have clear relationships
    2. Only consider relationships explicitly mentioned in the text; do not speculate
    3. For each found relationship, determine:
       - source: Title of the source entity of the relationship (must be an entity already in the entity list)
       - target: Title of the target entity of the relationship (must be an entity already in the entity list)
       - description: Concise and accurate relationship description (in English)
       - strength: Relationship strength based on the above criteria (an integer between 5-10)
    4. Check if each relationship is bidirectional:
       - If the relationship is bidirectional (e.g., "A is B's friend" means "B is also A's friend"), consider whether to create a reverse relationship
       - If the relationship is unidirectional (e.g., "A created B"), only keep the unidirectional relationship
    5. Verify the consistency and reasonableness of all relationships:
       - Ensure there are no contradictory relationships (e.g., A is both B's father and brother)
       - Ensure relationship descriptions match relationship strength
    6. Organize all valid relationships into a JSON array

          "Dream of the Red Chamber", also known as "The Story of the Stone", is one of China's Four Great Classical Novels created by Qing Dynasty writer Cao Xueqin, and is known as an encyclopedia of Chinese feudal society. The first 80 chapters were written by Cao Xueqin, and the last 40 chapters are generally believed to have been continued by Gao E.
          The novel is set against the backdrop of the rise and fall of the four great families of Jia, Shi, Wang, and Xue, and takes the love tragedy of Jia Baoyu, Lin Daiyu, and Xue Baochai as the main storyline, depicting a highly complex character ensemble centered around Jia Baoyu and the Twelve Beauties of Jinling.
          It was written during the Qianlong era (around 1743) and is a pinnacle of realism in Chinese literary history with far-reaching influence on later generations.
